# Permutations
Friend request and an opportunity to code in Java after a long time

# current status
Implemented a not efficient way to generate the permutations recursively

# future work
* Try out java8 collections API
* Try out java8 streams
* Show how nice it is in Scala
* Show how nice it is in Clojure
* Imperative approach
* Fastest implementations
* Benchmarck implementations


# Run
Just execute 'mvn test'
